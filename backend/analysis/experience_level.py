    Determines candidate experience level using strong resume signals.

    Logic:
    - Work experience sections → Experienced
    - Internship sections → Intermediate
    - Page count used as fallback heuristic
    - Avoids false positives from summary self-claims

    This is a rule-based classifier designed for explainability,
    not a machine learning model.
